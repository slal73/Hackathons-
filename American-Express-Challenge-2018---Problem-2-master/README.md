# American-Express-Challenge-2018---Problem-2
Problem 2 of AmEx Research Intern Challenge 2018 (Supervised Modeling with Emphasis on LAUC)
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
## Problem Statement:

<br/>
Supervised models are widely used to predict the probability of an event, such as whether a transaction is a fraud or an account will default or not. Many powerful algorithms exist to build suitable models, such as Boosting, Deep Learning, Support Vector Machines, etc. Measuring the effectiveness of such Machine Learning models is important to understand the value in the business. One measure is AUC (area under the curve), where the x-axis is the percentage of false positives and y-axis percentage of true positives. Due to the operational constraint/cost in many domains, only a small fraction of transactions can only be reviewed to confirm a prediction. For example, if a model scores 1MM transactions and the goal is to catch frauds, only top 5% transactions sorted by scores in descending order (assuming higher the score, more likely it will be a fraud) may be reviewed. In such a case, we also want high accuracy in the left area under the curve (LAUC) of the model besides good AUC. The goal is to build a supervised model on a sample of fraud data where both AUC and LAUC is as strong as possible
